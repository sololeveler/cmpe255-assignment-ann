# cmpe255-assignment-ann

Using any data set you want, implement colabs for the following ANN algorithms (see hints)

 

Write proper documentation in read.me file and colabs 

 

a) LSH

 

b) exhaustive search

c) product quantization

d) trees and graphs

e) hnsw

 

Hint : (use as motivation - not exact copy paste)
